# tmf-v4-utils
This project contains useful utility classes for dealing with TMF v4 model classes.

The reason this project is a separate project from the tmf-v4-models is, it might have new releases often whereas the model project is nearly static since it is generated from the original swagger files of the relevant TMF APIs.
